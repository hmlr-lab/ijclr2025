<p>Submissions are invited for the 4th International Joint Conference on Learning
and Reasoning, which is planned to be held in Nanjing, China, from September
20th to 22nd, 2024.  Since 2021, IJCLR has aimed at being the conference bringing
together the international AI community that is interested in the research of
integrating learning and reasoning for addressing many of the shortcomings of
contemporary AI approaches, including the black-box nature and the brittleness
of deep learning, and the difficulty to adapt knowledge representation models in
the light of new data.</p>

<p>The authors could submit their papers to the Journal Track, Main
Track, Extended Abstract Track, Recently Published Papers Track or the Special
Track (Formal Reasoning and Large Language Models); these tracks will post their
calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures, policies
may differ from what is described below.</p>

<p>Submissions are solicited on all aspects of Learning and Reasoning and topics
where machine learning is combined with machine reasoning or knowledge
representation.</p>

<p>Authors are invited to submit novel, high-quality work that has neither appeared

<p>Conference papers, describing original work with appropriate experimental
evaluation and/or a self-contained theoretical contribution. Submitted
conference papers should not have been published, or be under review for a
journal, or another conference with published proceedings. Conference papers may
be either long papers, of up to 15 pages, including references, or short papers
of up to 6-9 pages, including references. Submitted papers should contain a
substantial contribution that justifies their length, e.g. proofs of extensive
experimental studies.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/

Track cut-off dates. Submission to the IJCLR Main Track will be made online in May.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/

<p>IJCLR’s Journal Track, the Special Issue on Learning and Reasoning is supported by
the Machine Learning Journal (MLJ) and will accept paper submissions on regular cut-off dates.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/
dates/index.html">Important Dates</a> page for the Journal Track
cut-off dates.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/
guidelines/index.html">Submission Guidelines</a> page for
more information.</p>

<p>Journal Track papers are published online by the MLJ upon acceptance and authors
of accepted papers are invited to present their work at IJCLR.</p>
<p>Please note that the reviewing process for the MLJ submissions takes significantly longer than the conference papers and for many of the special issue papers the reviewing will be completed after the IJCLR conference each year and as a result the majority of the accepted MLJ special issue papers are invited for presentation at the next IJCLR conference.</p>

<p>IJCLR&rsquo;24 also invites papers submitted to the Special Track on &ldquo;Formal Reasoning
and Large Language Models&rdquo;. This unique track aims to bridge the gap between the
rigorous theoretical underpinnings of formal reasoning and the cutting-edge
advancements in large language models (LLMs) or other types of foundation
models. The Special Track aims to encourage pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s
possible when combining the soundness of formal reasoning with the versatility
of large language models.</p>

<p>The Special Track invites submissions of original research that explores
innovative intersections, methodologies, applications, and theoretical insights
into the integration of formal reasoning approaches with LLMs. Topics of interest include
but are not limited to the application of formal methods in training and
interpreting LLMs, leveraging LLMs for enhancing formal reasoning systems, novel
approaches to integrating logical reasoning within LLM frameworks, and empirical
studies that evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in formal reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>The page length limit and important dates of the Special Track will be the same
as the Main Track. Visit the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/
guidelines/index.html">Submission Guidelines</a> page for more information.</p>
