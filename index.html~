<p>The 4th International Joint Conference on Learning and Reasoning (IJCLR) will be held at Nanjing University International Conference Center, Nanjing, China, 19-22 September 2024.</p>

<p>The rapid progress in machine learning has been the primary reason for a fresh look at the transformative potential of AI as a whole during the past decade. A crucial milestone for taking full advantage of this potential is the endowment of algorithms that learn from experience with the ability to reason, which could consult existing knowledge that has already been learned and draw inferences that have a soundness guarantee.</p>

<p>The integration of learning and reasoning has been the key open question in AI, which calls for approaches that combine knowledge representation and machine reasoning techniques with learning algorithms from the fields of neural, statistical and relational learning, as well as cognition-inspired AI. In 2021, IJCLR was initiated through the amalgamation of several distinguished conferences/workshops in this field, each boasting a legacy spanning ten to thirty years: the International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), the International Workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP), the International Workshop on Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy), the International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI (StarAI), and the International Workshop on Cognitive AI has became a member from 2023.</p>

<p>Commencing in 2024, the International Joint Conference on Learning and Reasoning (IJCLR) has evolved from an aggregation of distinct workshops into a cohesive conference entity. This transformation encompasses the amalgamation of various topics of interest within the domains of learning and reasoning in artificial intelligence into a singular, integrated program. Furthermore, the conference now boasts a unified and extensive proceeding that serves as the official record for publications in this area. The ILP, AAIP, and CogAI have been integrated into the IJCLR program, signifying a consolidation of these areas under the IJCLR umbrella. Concurrently, NeSy and StarAI maintain their distinct conferences/workshops, focusing on their respective specialized topics. Despite this, they persist as pivotal components within the IJCLR framework, embodying two of the primary research domains. Their contribution to the IJCLR is further evidenced by the inclusion of dedicated area chairs and reviewers from both fields, underscoring their integral role in shaping the conference&rsquo;s comprehensive academic direction and ensuring its high quality.
