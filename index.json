A crucial milestone for taking full advantage of this potential is the endowment of algorithms that learn from experience with the ability to reason, which could consult existing knowledge that has already been learned and draw inferences that have a soundness guarantee.\nThe integration of learning and reasoning has been the key open question in AI, which calls for approaches that combine knowledge representation and machine reasoning techniques with learning algorithms from the fields of neural, statistical and relational learning, as well as cognition-inspired AI. In 2021, IJCLR was initiated through the amalgamation of several distinguished conferences/workshops in this field, each boasting a legacy spanning ten to thirty years: the International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), the International Workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP), the International Workshop on Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy), the International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI (StarAI), and the International Workshop on Cognitive AI has became a member from 2023.\nCommencing in 2024, the International Joint Conference on Learning and Reasoning (IJCLR) has evolved from an aggregation of distinct workshops into a cohesive conference entity. This transformation encompasses the amalgamation of various topics of interest within the domains of learning and reasoning in artificial intelligence into a singular, integrated program. Furthermore, the conference now boasts a unified and extensive proceeding that serves as the official record for publications in this area. The ILP, AAIP, and CogAI have been integrated into the IJCLR program, signifying a consolidation of these areas under the IJCLR umbrella. Concurrently, NeSy and StarAI maintain their distinct conferences/workshops, focusing on their respective specialized topics. Despite this, they persist as pivotal components within the IJCLR framework, embodying two of the primary research domains. Their contribution to the IJCLR is further evidenced by the inclusion of dedicated area chairs and reviewers from both fields, underscoring their integral role in shaping the conference\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive academic direction and ensuring its high quality.

Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a subfield of machine learning, focusing on learning logical representations from relational data. The ILP conference series, started in 1991, is the premier international forum for learning from structured or semi-structured relational data, multi-relational learning and data mining. Originally focusing on the induction of logic programs, over the years it has expanded its research horizon significantly and welcomes contributions to all aspects of learning in logic, statistical relational learning, graph and tree mining, learning in other (non-propositional) logic-based knowledge representation frameworks, exploring intersections to statistical learning and other probabilistic approaches. Invited Speakers  Véronique Ventos Presentation Title: Nook: a new generation AI dedicated to the game of Bridge  Presentation Abstract: On March 25 2024, at the end of a two-day Bridge tournament against eight world champions the Bridge AI Nook was declared victorious. This is a world première the game of bridge still being a great challenge to Artificial Intelligence.\nNooK is a new generation AI according to several aspects.\n The first one is related to the fact that Nook is hybrid since it is made up of symbolic rule-based modules and neural network one. Rather than learning by playing a huge amount of games, it begins by recovering and modeling human expertise in a Background Knowledge described using a relational logic. Moreover Nook is able to provide explanations related to each decision.\nThe robot is developed by NukkAI, a French start-up that we will present at the start of the talk. In the following we will give the basics of the game of bridge and its distinguishing characteristics from other mind games The other two parts will be devoted to the challenge and the description of the NooK modules.\n\nBio: Dr Véronique Ventos has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and was an Associate Professor at Paris-Sud University where she investigated Logical Knowledge Representation and Symbolic Machine Learning. She is also a world reference in the field of AI applied to games. In 2018 she cofounded NukkAI http://www.nukk.ai where as Head of Research she leads research on hybrid AI. NukkAI is committed to creating new generation AIs at the service of humans instead of replacing them and uses as a sandbox the game of Bridge which has resisted AI so far, unlike chess or Go. In 2024 her team achieved a major scientific breakthrough when Nook, the hybrid explainable AI designed by NukkAI, beat 8 world champions at a Bridge challenge that took place in Paris.

The workshop is the third of its kind to related to the EPSRC Human-Like Computing (HLC) and builds on successful talks and discussions between internationally leading researchers in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science at the MI20-HLC and MI21-HLC workshops in 2016 and 2019.\u0026nbsp; HLC 2024 will be held as a component of the 2nd International Joint Conference on Learning \u0026amp; Reasoning (IJCLR 2020), along with ILP 2024, NeSy 2024 and AAIP 2024.\nHuman-Like Computing (HLC) research aims to endow machines with human-like perceptual, reasoning and learning abilities which support collaboration and communication with human beings. Such abilities should support computers in interpreting the aims and intentions of humans based on learning and accumulated background knowledge to help identify contexts and cues from human behaviour. Techniques of this kind are required in applications in which close interactions are required between computers and human users. The workshop aim is to bring together leading experts in AI and Cognitive Science to investigate areas of fruitful interaction in which human co-operative and communicative skills can be studied and modelled computationally. While many of these issues have been prominent for some time in symbolic AI, we are yet to see successful integration of statistical and symbolic AI approaches which achieves the broad range of phenomena present in human behaviour. The workshop will contribute to the objectives of the EPSRC’s HLC area by crystalising the key research issues to be prioritised in this area.\n \nCall for Papers  We solicit submissions in all areas of Human-Like Computing. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:Comprehensibility Representation Change Small data learning Memory and forgetting Bridging high and low-level Verbal and non-verbal Intelligent tutoring Programming assistance Social agents Scientific assistance  We solicit three types of submissions:Workshop papers: They should describing original works that are not being reviewed or published elsewhere.

This synergy is motivated by the goal of creating AI systems that not only process information with the efficiency and scalability of data-driven machine learning but also engage in knowledge-driven problem-solving and decision-making with the depth and flexibility of human-like reasoning. The integration of the two facets in AI holds the potential of addressing many of the shortcomings of contemporary AI approaches, including the black-box nature and the brittleness of deep learning, and the difficulty to adapt knowledge representation models in the light of new data. The challenge of the integration calls for approaches that combine knowledge representation and machine reasoning techniques with learning algorithms from the fields of neural, statistical and relational learning, as well as cognitive science. Various communities are addressing it: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Inductive Programming (IP) are proposed as a form of machine learning (ML) that could induce hypotheses (programs) that generalizes given training examples using formal reasoning techniques; Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy)’s goal is to integrate symbolic reasoning with neural networks, which has recently attracted a lot of attention; Statistical Relational Learning and Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) focus on integrating logical and probabilistic reasoning by studying their semantics and making learning/inference more tractable; Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (CogAI) aim at bringing together leading experts in AI and Cognitive Science to investigate areas of fruitful interaction in which human co-operative and communicative skills can be studied and modeled computationally. Previously, IJCLR served as a joint event for a series of international conferences and workshops in related research fields.Beginning in the year 2024, the Steering Committee, of the International Joint Conference on Learning and Reasoning (IJCLR) has undertaken a strategic initiative to transform the conference from a collection of individual workshops into a unified and integrated academic event. This integration aimed at fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and enhancing the depth and breadth of discussions within the conference. Additionally, IJCLR introduced a unified set of proceedings, establishing a consolidated publication record that serves as an authoritative source for cutting-edge research and developments in the domain of the integration of learning and reasoning in AI.\nWithin this restructured format, the ILP, AAIP, and CogAI have been seamlessly incorporated into the IJCLR program, reflecting a comprehensive consolidation of these research areas under the IJCLR's overarching framework. In parallel, NeSy and StarAI continue to organize their dedicated conferences and workshops, maintaining a focus on their specific research directions. Despite their independent activities, NeSy and StarAI remain integral to the IJCLR's core mission, representing key pillars within its research agenda. Their significant contribution to the conference is further highlighted by the involvement of area chairs and program committee members from these fields, playing a critical role in steering the conference towards a holistic academic direction and maintaining the highest standards of quality in its scholarly output. \nPast Events\n      IJCLR  IJCLR 20-21, Virtual at IJCLR 2021\nIJCLR 2022, Cumberland Lodge, United Kingdom\nIJCLR 2023, Bari, Italy\n ILP ILP 2023, Bari, Italy\nILP 2022, Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom\nILP 2020-21, Virtual at IJCLR 2021\nILP 2019, Plovdiv, Bulgaria\nILP 2018, Ferrara, Italy\nILP 2017, Orléans, France\nILP 2016, London, UK\nILP 2015, Kyoto, Japan\nILP 2014, Nancy, France\nILP 2013, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nILP 2012, Dubrovnik, Croatia\nILP 2011, Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom\nILP 2010, Firenze, Italy\nILP 2009, Leuven, Belgium\nILP 2008, Prague, Czech Republic\nILP 2007, Corvallis, Oregon, USA\nILP 2006, Santiago, Spain\nILP 2005, Bonn, Germany\nILP 2004, Porto, Portugal\nILP 2003, Szeged, Hungary\nILP 2002, Sydney, Australia\nILP 2001, Strasbourg, France\nILP 2000, London, UK\nILP 1999, Bled, Slovenia\nILP 1998, Madison, Wisconsin, USA\nILP 1997, Prague, Czech Republic\nILP 1996, Stockholm, Sweden\nILP 1995, Leuven, Belgium\nILP 1994, Bonn, Germany\nILP 1993, Bled, Slovenia\nILP 1992, Tokyo, Japan\nILP 1991, Viana do Castelo, Portugal\n StarAI  StarAI 2022\nStarAI 2021\nStarAI 2020\nStarAI 2018\nStarAI 2017\nStarAI 2016\nStarAI 2015\nStarAI 2014\nStarAI 2013\nStarAI 2012\nStarAI 2010\n  AAIP  AAIP 2023, Germany\nAAIP 2022 @ IJCLR 2022, Cumberland Lodge, United Kingdom.\nAAIP 2021, Germany\nAAIP 2019, Germany\nAAIP 2017, Germany\nAAIP 2015, Germany\nAAIP 2013, Germany\nAAIP 2011, co-located with PPDP 2011 and LOPSTR 2011, Odense, Denmark\nAAIP 2009, in Edinburgh, Scotland\nAAIP 2007, at ICML 2007 in Warsaw, Poland\nAAIP 2005, at ICML 2005 in Bonn, Germany\n CogAI  CogAI 2023, Bari, Italy HLC 2022, Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom MI21-HLC, 2019, Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom MI20-HLC, 2016, Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom   NeSy  NeSy'23, Certosa di Pontignano, Italy\nNeSy'22 @ IJCLR-22, Cumberland Lodge, UK\nNeSy'21 @ IJCLR-21, Virtual (recordings)\nNeSy'19 @ IJCAI-19, Macao, China\nNeSy'18 @ HLAI-18, Prague, CZ\nNeSy'17 @ City, University of London, UK\nNeSy'16 @ HLAI-16, New York City, NY\nNeSy'15 @ IJCAI-15, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nNeSy'13 @ IJCAI-13, Beijing, China NeSy'12 @ AAAI-12, Toronto, Canada NeSy'11 @ IJCAI-11, Barcelona, Catalonia\nNeSy'10 @ AAAI-10, Atlanta, Georgia\nNeSy'09 @ IJCAI-09, Pasadena, California\nNeSy'08 @ ECAI-08, Patras, Greece\nNeSy'07 @ IJCAI-07, Hydarabad, India\nNeSy'06 @ ECAI-06, Riva del Garda, Italy\n   table { width: 100%; } td, th { padding: 15px; text-align: left; valign: top; } li { margin-bottom: 5px; }  ","permalink":"https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/ijclr24/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":null,"contents":"General Information:  Submissions are invited for the 4th International Joint Conference on Learning and Reasoning, which is planned to be held in Nanjing, China, from September 20th to 22nd, 2024.
